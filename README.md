# Remarks

This repository contains the code for my final project for CS559-Computer Graphics, taken at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Michael Gleicher in Spring 2023. This repo is an abridged version that leaves out some of the example "starter code" and the workbook web page itself.

The vast majority of the content in `for_students` was written by me, although there is some boilerplate content that was provided to me by the class:
- `final-grtown.html`
- Most of `final-grtown.js`
- The files in `assets` were taken from a variety of sources as described in `final-02-attributions.txt`
- The prompts in each txt file

Everything in `libs` was provided to me as part of the class. See below for more information. I also didn't add anything to the `js` folder.

The following is taken from the original README written by Professor Gleicher:

# CS559 Workbook, Spring 2023

This set of web pages forms a "workbook" assignment for 
CS559, Computer Graphics at the University of Wisconsin for Spring 2022.

Students should run a local web server and start with the `index.html` page.
The html files may not work as "files" without a local server.

Information about the class is available on the course web:
https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Courses/559-sp23/

The `for_students` sub-directory contains files for the students to read and
modify. 

The `libs` sub-directory contains libraries used by the workbook. These
have separate open source licenses provided in the directories. 

The workbook content was primarily developed by Prof. Michael Gleicher with
assistance from the course staff over the years.

Students are granted the right to use the workbook content for their work
in class.
